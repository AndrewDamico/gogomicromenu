# CLI Menu System: Status Updates

## Status Updates

### Status Update (2024-05-18 10:00 UTC)
- **Core types, layout, and rendering logic are implemented and working.**
- **Fluent builder API is in place.**
- **Partial screen clearing (3.4) and paging (4.x) are next priorities.**
- **No major issues encountered so far.**
- **User story:** As a developer, I want to define menu regions (header, main, options, fence, input) and have them automatically slotted and rendered, so I can build complex CLI menus with minimal code.
- **Next steps:** Implement partial screen clearing, paging logic, and begin wiring up user input and interaction.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 10:30 UTC)
- **Partial screen clearing implementation is next.**
- **Paging logic design is being planned; will ensure pagers are always at the correct slot and not selectable.**
- **No regressions in builder API or layout logic.**
- **User story:** As a developer, I want the menu area to clear and redraw cleanly, so the CLI remains readable and professional.
- **Next steps:** Implement partial screen clearing in the Render method, then add paging logic for overflowing Divs.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 11:00 UTC)
- **Paging logic is now implemented for Divs with Pager=true.**
- **Partial screen clearing is working.**
- **Menu system now supports scrolling through long lists of options or main items.**
- **No regressions in layout or rendering.**
- **User story:** As a user, I want to scroll through long menus using < and >, so I can access all options even if they don't fit on the screen.
- **Next steps:** Add input handling for < and > to change pages, and document demo instructions.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 11:15 UTC)
- Fixed go.mod syntax: use `module github.com/AndrewDamico/gogomicromenu` (no equals sign).
- After correcting, run `go mod tidy` to update dependencies.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 11:30 UTC)
- Fixed: Library code must be in a named package (not main) at the module root.
- Move menu.go to the repo root and set `package gogomicromenu`.
- Demo code stays in bin/micromenu/main.go as `package main`.
- Now the import path in main.go will work as expected.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 11:45 UTC)
- Noted: Partial screen clearing will overwrite lines printed immediately before the menu area.
- To see "Before menu", print extra newlines or comment out screen clearing for the demo.
- This is expected behavior for a CLI menu that redraws in-place.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 12:00 UTC)
- Added interactive paging demo: user can press `<` or `>` to scroll through menu pages.
- Demonstrates dynamic menu redraw and stateful paging.
- User story: As a user, I want to page through menu options interactively, so I can see all available choices.
- Next: Add selection logic for numbered options, and highlight the currently selected item.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 13:00 UTC)
- Refactored: Pager logic moved to `pager.go` for modularity and clarity.
- Added `pager.md` to document paging design and usage.
- Next: Implement selection logic and user input mapping for menu items.

### Status Update (2024-05-18 23:00 UTC)
- **Development paused for the night.**
- **Current state:**  
  - Core menu system, layout, rendering, partial screen clearing, and paging are implemented and stable.
  - Interactive paging demo is working.
  - Codebase is being modularized (e.g., pager logic moving to `pager.go`).
  - Documentation and backlog are separated and up to date.
- **Next steps for resuming:**  
  1. Complete the refactor by moving all pager logic to `pager.go` and documenting in `pager.md`.
  2. Implement selection logic for menu items (number/key assignment and highlighting).
  3. Map user input to menu actions and update menu state accordingly.
  4. Continue modularizing code and documenting major components in dedicated markdown files.
- **Tips for resuming:**  
  - Review `backlog.md` for remaining features.
  - Review `micromenu.md` for chronological status and design decisions.
  - Review new documentation files (e.g., `pager.md`) for component-specific details.
  - All code is in sync with the current design and ready for further extension.
- **No blockers or critical issues.**

**To resume:**  
- Start by reviewing this status update and the latest code/doc artifacts.
- Continue with the next backlog item or modularization/documentation as needed.
